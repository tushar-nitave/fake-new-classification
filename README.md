#### Findings

It is observed that we are dealing with highly imbalanced data so we have to use different strategies for 
sampling the data to make it balanced.

Make dataset balanced:

    - SMOTE
    - undersampling
    - SMOTE + ENN


#### Varun's Take
To handle imbalance data

    - Removing data redundancy
        - Using some similarity measures to remove redundant data (https://medium.com/@adriensieg/text-similarities-da019229c894)

    - If still imbalanced then we can go for SMOTHE
        -Unfortunately, this technique doesnâ€™t work well with text data because the numerical vectors that are created from the text are very high dimensional   

    - Data Augmentation :
        - creating new minority data by transforming(rotate, translate, scale, add some noise) to the ones in the data set
