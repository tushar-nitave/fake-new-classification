## Fake News Classification

Overall idea of the project it to classify the given the title of a fake news article A and the title of a coming news article B, into three categories: 
	Agreed: B talks about the same fake news as A. 
Disagreed: B refutes the fake news in A. 
Unrelated: B is unrelated to A.

We try to understand the semantic meaning of the given text article and then try to classify in one of these 3 categories. We have discussed how we plan to go about this in the method section.
